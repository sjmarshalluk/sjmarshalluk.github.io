Starting in the heart of the Polesden Lacey estate three brand new routes for 2019 consisting of long gradual climbs, alpine like forests, technical descents and stunning views, await for trail runners of all ability looking for a challenge. Our Original Surrey event may be nestled within the grounds of a peaceful picture-perfect estate, but don’t be deceived, as all three routes have a serious amount of twists, turn, up and downs that will require some fierce leg work. All three routes take you on an adventure through ancient woodlands, the notorious Surrey hills and onto the North downs Way. In 2018 our Surrey event was one of the most popular events of the season due to its proximity to London, with direct trains from London Waterloo to Dorking taking less than 1 hour, or the drive being 90 minutes from London City straight to the race start.",

    "description":"The all new Maverick Inov-8 Ultra Trail Series Exmoor (UTSE) point to point is the ultimate in endurance events. It’s the product of our favourite X Series and our hardest Original Series events. On paper you may not see the largest amount of elevation over the 55 mile route, but the extremely hard, roller coaster-like terrain, with minimal flat sections, make it incredibly demanding, both physically and mentally. Once you leave the start venue at Caffyns Farm in Exmoor, the tone is instantly set. There’s a tough climb within the first 2k, and you will be climbing for quite some time during the first stage of the race. Your eyes will be drawn to the epic scenery, first the Valley of the Rocks, then the climb to Foreland Point. From there will be your first technical descent, with loose scree on sheer cliff face - this event is not for the faint-hearted. Finish location is Kilve Court, Kilve, Bridgwater.",
